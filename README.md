# CuttleFlow

CuttleFlow is a program that rewrites Data analysis workflow according to its execution context.
To run our program on the *rnasplice* workflow, execute the following commands:
```
cd source
python cuttleflow.py
```

You can change the paths in `source/cuttleflow.py` to load another workflow, input or infrastructure description. 

More details about usage is coming soon.
