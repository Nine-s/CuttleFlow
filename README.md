# CuttleFlow

CuttleFlow is a program that rewrites Data Analysis Workflows according to its execution context.
To run our program on the *rnasplice* workflow, execute the following commands:
```
bash cuttleflow.sh --descriptionFolder test/rnasplice-description --output ../generated_daw_rnasplice_test
```

By changing the description folder, you can load another workflow, input and infrastructure description. 
You can change the output folder where the DAW is generated by changing the path of the `--output` argument.

## Creating your own description files

The description files consist of:
```
description_folder
|-- DAW.json
|-- INFRA.json
|-- INPUT.json
`-- SPLIT_MERGE_TASKS.json
```
